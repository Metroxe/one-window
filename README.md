# one-window

## Product description
One-Window is a tiny macOS menu bar utility that keeps Google Chrome to a maximum number of windows (currently 2, configurable in future). It continuously watches for new Chrome windows and automatically closes any extras the moment they appear, keeping your workspace focused and clutter-free.

- Runs as a menu bar app (no Dock icon, just in the top toolbar)
- Lightweight and always accessible from the menu bar
- Targets Google Chrome windows only; the first N windows remain open
- Does not interfere with other apps or system windows
- Open source and privacy-first; no network or analytics

**Note:** Closing an extra window will also close the tabs contained in that window. Use this app only if you intentionally want Chrome restricted to a limited number of windows at all times.

## Technical Overview

### Architecture
One-Window is a native macOS SwiftUI application that uses the **Accessibility API** to monitor and manage Chrome windows.

### Key Components

#### 1. **AccessibilityPermission.swift**
Handles macOS Accessibility permission requests and status checking.
- `isTrusted()` - Checks if Accessibility permission is granted
- `requestIfNeeded()` - Triggers the system permission prompt
- `openSettings()` - Opens System Settings to Accessibility pane

#### 2. **ChromeWindowManager.swift**
Core monitoring and enforcement logic using the Accessibility API.
- Uses `NSRunningApplication` to detect Chrome process
- Uses `AXUIElement` API to query Chrome's window list
- Programmatically closes windows beyond the configured limit by triggering the close button
- Polls every 0.5 seconds via a Timer
- **Max windows:** Currently hardcoded to `2` (TODO: make configurable via UI)

#### 3. **ContentView.swift (MenuBarView)**
Compact SwiftUI menu bar interface for monitoring controls.
- Shows real-time monitoring status with indicator
- Start/stop monitoring toggle
- Real-time stats: current window count, total windows closed
- Quick access to System Settings for permissions
- Quit button with keyboard shortcut (âŒ˜Q)

#### 4. **one_windowApp.swift**
App entry point using SwiftUI's `MenuBarExtra` for menu bar-only interface.
- Configures the app to appear only in the menu bar (no Dock icon)
- Uses `LSUIElement` to hide from Dock

### Permissions Required
- **Accessibility**: Required to read Chrome's window list and trigger close buttons via the Accessibility API
- **No Automation permission needed**: Originally attempted with AppleScript, but switched to pure Accessibility API to avoid the Automation permission complexity

### Build Configuration
- **App Type:** Menu bar application (LSUIElement = YES)
- **App Sandbox:** Disabled (required for Accessibility API to work across apps)
- **Hardened Runtime:** Enabled
- **Entitlements:** Minimal - sandbox disabled to allow inter-app communication
- **Deployment Target:** macOS (SwiftUI MenuBarExtra app)

### How It Works
1. App launches and appears in the menu bar (top-right corner)
2. User clicks the menu bar icon to access controls
3. User grants Accessibility permission via System Settings if needed
4. User starts monitoring from the menu bar interface
5. Timer polls every 0.5s:
   - Checks if Chrome is running
   - Gets list of Chrome windows via `kAXWindowsAttribute`
   - If window count > max (2), closes windows at index 2+
   - Closing is done by finding each window's `kAXCloseButtonAttribute` and performing `kAXPressAction`
6. Menu bar UI updates with real-time window counts and stats

### Future Enhancements (TODOs)
- Make max window count configurable via UI
- Support for "Launch at Login"
- Temporary pause/allow mode
- Support for other browsers (Safari, Firefox, etc.)
- Per-profile window limits
- Customizable poll interval

### Development Notes
- Built with Xcode, Swift 5.0, SwiftUI
- No external dependencies
- Uses only native macOS frameworks: AppKit, ApplicationServices
- Debug builds may require manual permission grants in System Settings
