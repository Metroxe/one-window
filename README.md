# one-window

## Product description
One-Window is a tiny macOS utility that keeps Google Chrome to a single window. It continuously watches for new Chrome windows and automatically closes any extras the moment they appear, keeping your workspace focused and clutter-free.

- Runs silently in the background on macOS
- Targets Google Chrome windows only; the primary Chrome window remains open
- Does not interfere with other apps or system windows
- Open source and privacy-first; no network or analytics

Note: Closing an extra window will also close the tabs contained in that window. Use this app only if you intentionally want Chrome restricted to a single window at all times.
